# 🌐 Your Website URLs

After pushing to GitHub, use these URLs:

## 📚 Interactive Website (Recommended)
**Your friend can run code, edit, and learn interactively!**

```
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sumanth-naik/Striver-191/master
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Fully interactive - can execute all code cells
- ✅ Can edit and experiment
- ✅ No installation needed
- ⏱️ First load: ~2 minutes (then cached and fast)

---

## 📖 Static View (Fast, Read-Only)
**Instant viewing, but can't run code**

```
https://nbviewer.org/github/sumanth-naik/Striver-191/blob/master/Python_DSA_Syntax_Notebook.ipynb
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Instant loading
- ✅ Good for quick reference
- ❌ Read-only (can't execute code)

---

## 🚀 To Push to GitHub:

**Option 1: Use the script**
```bash
./PUSH_AND_GET_URL.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual commands**
```bash
git add Python_DSA_Syntax_Notebook.ipynb requirements.txt runtime.txt
git commit -m "Add Python DSA syntax notebook"
git push origin master
```

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**Share the INTERACTIVE URL** with your friend:
```
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sumanth-naik/Striver-191/master
```

They can click it, wait ~2 minutes for the first build, and then start learning interactively!
